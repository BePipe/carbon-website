Create a folder if\n   your team doesn’t have one yet.\n2. Click `Add file` (top right), then `Create new file`.\n3. Name your file `component-name.yml`, where _component-name_ is the name of\n   your component.\n4. Copy and paste the following template into the `Edit new file` section of the\n   page and fill out the correct information for your component.\n\n   ```\n   name: component name\n   website_url: >-\n     url of documentation / guidance page (if any)\n   code_url: >-\n     url of component code on GitHub\n   maintainer: name of maintainer team\n   description: >-\n     short description of purpose and usage of component\n   framework: choose one of Vanilla | Angular | React | Vue\n   design_asset: choose one of Sketch | Axure | Adobe XD | Figma\n   platform: Web\n   aliases:\n     - fuzzy term for component (e.g. an alias for a \"card\" component might be \"tile\")\n   date_added: YYY-MM-DDT00:00:00.000Z\n   ```\n\n5. Once done, click the green `Commit new file` button at the bottom.\n\nAfter submitting the PR for the data, you should upload a thumbnail image.\n\n1.

The Carbon team will review and merge the PR.\n\nIf you’re unsure about how to make a PR through GitHub, create an issue in the\nrepo instead and we’ll help you out.
